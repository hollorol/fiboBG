# FiboBG

FiboBG is a very simple program which displays the [Fibonacci clock](https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/may/09/fibonacci-clock-can-you-tell-the-time-on-the-worlds-most-stylish-nerd-timepiece). It creates a dynamic background for simple window manager like i3 or dwm. FiboBG was only tested on dwm. The program works well with compositors like compton.

git clone https://github.com/hollorol/fiboBG.git
